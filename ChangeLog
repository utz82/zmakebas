	* Combined the zmakebas 1.41-alpha version
		from http://www.ianjohnston.com/
		with the version by Antonio Villena (which I am calling 1.42) at
		https://sourceforge.net/p/emuscriptoria/code/HEAD/tree/desprot/ZMakeBas.c
			which fixes the DEF FN issue where the program fails to run with a Q Parameter Error
			and can also create ZX81 .p files.
	* Fixed a case statement increment issue in 1.42 memcpycnv that prevented compilation
	* Fixed an issue in 1.42 dbl2spec where function would loop endlessly if num param was 0
	* Windows version compiled by @utz at http://www.worldofspectrum.org/forums/discussion/51025/fix-for-the-def-fn-bug-of-zmakebas#latest
	* Version 1.5.
